**CDPwn** is a python script designed to capture screenshots of files via the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP), a technique useful for privilege escalation when the CDP service runs with root permissions 🛡️. The script leverages the `pycdp` library to interact with CDP and the `pwn` library to manage network connections. This functionality is particularly advantageous for gaining higher-level access to systems where CDP runs with elevated privileges 🔒.

## Demo ✏️

## Dependencies 📦

- `argparse`: Standard library for parsing command-line arguments.
- `asyncio`: Standard library for handling asynchronous I/O operations.
- `base64`: Standard library for encoding and decoding binary data.
- `pycdp`: Third-party library for interfacing with the Chrome DevTools Protocol. Available at https://github.com/HMaker/python-cdp. Note: You may need to modify `target.py` within this library, for instance, changing `can_access_opener=bool(json['canAccessOpener']),` to `can_access_opener=bool(json.get('canAccessOpener',False)),`.
- `pwn`: Third-party library for improve the screen output.

## Command-Line Arguments 💻

`cdpwn.py` accepts the following command-line arguments:

- `-i` or `--ip` 📶: Required. IP address to connect to.
- `-p` or `--port` 🔌: Required. Port to connect to.
- `-f` or `--file` 📂: Required. File to navigate to.
- `-s` or `--screenshot` 📸: Optional. Name of the screenshot file. Defaults to 'screenshot.png' if not specified.

## Usage Examples 🚀

To capture a screenshot from a local CDP server running at IP address `127.0.0.1` on port `46717`, and navigate to `/root/.ssh/id_rsa`, use the following command:

```shell
python3 cdpwn.py -i 127.0.0.1 -p 46717 -f /root/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will generate a screenshot file named 'screenshot.png' in the same directory as the script.

**Note:** The script uses the `file://` protocol to navigate to the specified file, which should be located on the server that the script connects to.
